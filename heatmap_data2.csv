I also think we will learn to visulize data in a way that can show correlations etc that may be hard to spott if it was just number in a excel sheet.,DD1393 (VT20) We built a sound visualizer for the vic studio at kth. DA2210 (HT20) Since the course is about science is included part about how to analyse and plot data in graph etc.,Have not started planning for it.,I'm aiming for becoming a data scientist and i will probably work in industry. I'm unsure at what kind of company i want to work for tho since i find most things interesting so i have a hard time choosing.

Those are my 5 interests and hobbies.,Yes - several times a day.,No - but I wouldn't mind using it.,Yes - but only a few times a week.,I have no expectations. I hope it will be a fun and interesting course - but I don't know what to expect in terms of what I'll learn.,Honestly don't know. Maybe DD1354 - DH2323 at KTH are somehow relevant? It's been years since I completed those though - and any other related course would be even longer ago.,Have not started planning for it.,I just want a job that allows me to afford a house - garage - two cars and one or two motorcycles. I guess Industry or consultant. Entrepreneur and independent contractors seem like they require too much effort.
